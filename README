Benu
====

Operating System Increments for Education and Research
(_Built for _education, _not (normal) _usage)

Simple operating system for demonstration only (academic)
Build through several steps, each bringing something new.
System is "work in progress", improved/extended with (almost) every year.

Name "Benu", besides acronym, represents an Egyptian bird...

Previous version (https://github.com/l30nard0/os4ec/) is used in academic year
2011/2012 in course Operating System for Embedded Computers. This one will
be used in next, 2012/2013 year.

This version (Benu) changed interface (among many other things) to POSIX.

IMPORTANT!
==========
If running created system (built from Benu) in emulator other than QEMU, set
standard input and output to vga_text mode -- in conf/config.ini set:
K_INITIAL_STDOUT = vga_text_dev, K_STDOUT = VGA_TXT, U_STDIN = i8042,
U_STDOUT = VGA_TXT, U_STDERR = VGA_TXT (uncomment this lines, comment other with
*=COM1)
(Buggy serial port implementation; works on QEMU but not with other emulators)



Please report any bugs (and other problems) on site or via email.

DISCLAIMER
==========
Presented system has (probably) *many* bugs! Many concepts might not be
adequate or good as might be (as are in some "real systems").
*Please* do not use it for any other purpose other than education.
Its not tested near enough to be used for anything more.
